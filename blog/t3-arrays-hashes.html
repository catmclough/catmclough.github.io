  <h1>Ruby Storage Methods: Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
  <h4>June 7, 2015</h4>

      There comes a time in your Ruby-life when storing every piece of data you're keeping track of in separate variables just doesn't make sense. Let's think about a dictionary program, for example, where a user inputs a word and the program spits out its etymology. In order to access the etymology when the program recieves the input, you'll need a way of finding it in the database. Using variables would be very difficult, however, because it would be very tedious to store the words as such:

      `word_one = 'aardvark'`
      `word_two = 'abide'`

      That could go on forever. Instead, it would be great if you could store them in a long list, with numbers pointing to each individual word. This is exactly what arrays do! An array is, in short, a list of data with 'slots' that are numbered starting at 0. If the user types in 'aardvark', you can write your program so that it looks to the array at position 0 (`dictionary_array[0]`)
      where the etymology of aardvark is stored. Arrays are incredibly useful, especially when building more advanced programs where arrays are used store multiple types of data or even arrays within arrays.

      You can get away with a lot using arrays, but in certain situations, a different storage class called 'Hash' can come in handy. Hashes are similar to arrays in every way but two: 1. They are unordered and 2. They can use any data type to point to their storage, rather than the regular old integers that arrays rely on. Let's jump right back into our example to hash this out.

      A dictionary is a perfect situation to use hashes, because it makes more sense to reference something like etymology with a corresponding string, rather than a number. For example, when creating our hash we'd make the reference a dictionary word, like 'aardvark', and the etymology as the data it points to, as such:

      `dictionary_hash['aardvark'] = "1825-35; Afrikaans erdvark / Dutch aardvarken, equivalent to aarde (earth) + varken (pig)"`

      See how that can be useful? With a dictionary reference app, we don't necessarily need to place our data in order, we just need to be able to find each slot using a dynamic reference. This is the beauty of hashes.
