  <h1>Some Thoughts On Pairing</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>June 21, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>     Now 5 weeks in to Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, my friends and family are starting to ask how I've liked the experience so far. I tell them the work is interesting, the challenges are time consuming, and the progress comes quickly. But the most difficult part, I tell them, are the requirements to work closely with strangers over video chat three times a week. Just getting these sessions scheduled is one of the most stressful aspects of my coursework, not to mention the difficulty of communicating with a stranger about a subject both parties have only just begun to learn.
    </p>
    <p>     Despite the inherent discomfort that come along with these peer-pairing sessions, I have to say the experience has gotten better with each week as my cohort and I learn how to communicate about technical challenges. The first peer-pairing sessions I participated in contained long silences and confusion about best practices and specific goals. In recent weeks, however, my pairs have been great at distributing the workload and switching roles between driver and navigator, student and teacher. When they go well, the pairing sessions really help clarify the curriculum and expose you to methods and approaches you never would have thought of yourself. I just wish it wasn't so hard trying to find the time for three meet-ups while I continue to work a full-time job.
    </p>
    <p>     At the end of every week, when I submit my work, I'm always reminded of the fact that I haven't given feedback to the people I paired with that week. To be honest, I dread giving feedback. Most of the people I work with are excellent pairs who don't need any advice from me. They are considerate and helpful and I can't ask anything more from them. I've only once been able to give some real constructive criticism to a pair, so having to do it every time and repeating the positive feedback for all my other pairs has felt a bit pointless. Reading the feedback my pairs have written for me has  given me the sense that other people are having the same problem I am, in that we have no problems with pairing! I haven't really taken much away from the feedback I've received except for the fact that people are OK with working with me. On the other hand, I see how the process can help a person improve their sessions if they've been having trouble working with others, I just haven't encountered many people who seem to have this problem. Having to rate other people's feedback is quick and easy, so I can't complain. This process helps keep the criticism constructive and the weeds out any commenters who are too harsh or vague.
    </p>
    <p>     Overall my experiences in pairing have been productive and have, I believe, improved my technical and cultural coding skills. If there is one downside to the process it has been the strict guidelines to giving feedback and meta-feedback, which I haven't yet found to be helpful on either front.
