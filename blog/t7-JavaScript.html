  <h1>From Ruby to JavaScript</h1>
  <h2>Week 7 of DBC Phase 0, a.k.a JavaScript Week.</h2>
  <h3>July 12, 2015</h3>

  <section>
    <p>
      This week we embarked on a new adventure in JavaScript. JS seems like a really cool framework that will be very powerful one day when I know how to use it. It's made for web applications that are dynamic and interactive, as opposed to the static pages of HTML like the one you're reading now (as of July '15). This is verye exciting, to me, but it's always a bit frustrating having to start fresh with a new framework when you're just starting to figure one out. Here are some differences and similarities between Ruby and JavaScript that I would have liked to know at the beginning of this week:
    </p>
    <h3>Hashes : Ruby :: Objects : JavaScript (in some ways)</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript objects are similar to hashes, in Ruby, because they have properties that point to various kinds of data. A JS object's property can even be a function! This left me very confused as I tried to make programs where objects contained multiple functions and other properties that those functions could modify. What you have to remember is that variables created in an onject's function are local to that object. If you want them to modify the object's data outside the function, look into using the `this` keyword.
    </p>
    <h3>Looping in JavaScript is nothing like looping in Ruby.</h3>
    <p>
      And this makes me very happy. My foundation is in Java, so have to use #each #map and other Ruby functions to loop through things often left me confused. I much prefer the style JavaScript uses, which is exactly the same way it's done in Java. For loops are given three arguments: the first = the index at which to begin looping, the second = the index at which to stop looping, the third = the increment you'd like to switch between indeces as you loop. I paired with a few people this week who were very confused by this syntax, and I don't blame them. I think most people would say Ruby's looping style is simpler. For me, JavaScript's for-loops offer much more flexibilty and simplicity.
    </p>
    <h3>JavaScript can be accomodating to a fault.</h3>
    <p>
      When you give the wrong number of arguments in a method call in Ruby, you get an ArugmentError with a nice little message about how many arguments you included and how many the method was created to receive.When you forget to close a brace or include an `end` declaration, Ruby makes sure you know it. I miss these errors. JavaScript is too nice! Your program will run and the thing you wanted it to do is not happening but there are no errors or warnings telling you why. This is what they call a flexible language. They semi-colons at the end of statements and the use of curly braces only seem to be suggestions. Strict rules may be annoying when your Ruby code won't run, but you'll miss those angry, red messages when your JavaScript code doesn't work and you have no idea why.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, I think I'd summarize this week's attempt to squeeze my Ruby programming knowledge into workable JavaScript code using the following GIF:
