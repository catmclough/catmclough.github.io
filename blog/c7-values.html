  <h1>Combating Stereotype Threats in Tech</h1>
  <!-- <h2>The subtitle, if you want it</h2> -->

      This week we've been asked to think about stereotypes in the workplace and how noobie developers like ourselves foresee the problem affecting us as we enter the world of software development. The first part of this assignment is to think about the values that make me feel proudest and happiest. First and foremost, friendship jumps out from the list of possibilities provided. Friendship can take on many forms and can be developed in personal and professional environments. As opposed to kindness, my definition of an act of friendship is one that shows acceptance and respect beyond the formality of common courtesy.  On the contrary, I see the opposite of friendship as exclusion -- whereas a colleague or acquaintance might treat you with cordiality and professional respect, but fail to include you in more convivial conversations that they may embark on with other peers.

        I think friendship jumps out from the list because I've felt happiest in my workplace and academic environments when my peers and I can talk candidly and bond over shared experiences. I try to live up to my idea of the importance of friendship at all times. This doesn't mean that you need to invite your colleagues over for dinner for share personal information with them in order to bond, but it does mean that you try to treat everyone you work with and meet with a compassion and 'friendliness'.

        The reason I bring this up is that, based on many first-hand accounts I've read, friendship among co-workers in the tech industry is one of the most exciting parts of the field, but it can also be punishing for those subject to stereotypes. Women and minorities are often excluded from hacker culture, which tends to intimidate and excluded everyone but young, straight males. I came across a GIF recently (I can't find it, but if I do I'll post it here) on a code culture blog that showed a bunch of male cartoons turning around looking shocked and awed. The caption read "When a girl walks in to the open space." I think this explains perfectly what I'm getting at when it comes to acceptance / friendship in thwe workplace and how sterotypes can ruin these values. When people look at you as an outsider then they won't talk to you like they do their other friends/co-workers and you won't be considered an equal and this can ruin your experience and relationship with these people. I think it's important, therefor, to really focus on friendship and inclusion when it comes to meeting new people, whether you look and talk and think like eachother or not.
