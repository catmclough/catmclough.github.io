  <h1>Combating Stereotype Threats in Tech</h1>
  <!-- <h2>The subtitle, if you want it</h2> -->
  <h4>July 12, 2015</h4>

      This week we've been asked to think about stereotypes in the workplace and how noobie developers like ourselves foresee the problem affecting us as we enter the world of software development. The first part of this assignment is to think about the values that make me feel proudest and happiest. First and foremost, friendship jumps out from the list of possibilities provided. Friendship can take on many forms and can be developed in personal and professional environments. As opposed to kindness, my definition of an act of friendship is one that shows acceptance and respect beyond the formality of common courtesy.  On the contrary, I see the opposite of friendship as exclusion -- whereas a colleague or acquaintance might treat you with cordiality and professional respect, but fail to include you in more convivial conversations that they may embark on with other peers.

        I think friendship jumps out from the list because I've felt happiest in my workplace and academic environments when my peers and I can talk candidly and bond over shared experiences. I try to live up to my idea of the importance of friendship at all times. This doesn't mean that you need to invite your colleagues over for dinner for share personal information with them in order to bond, but it does mean that you try to treat everyone you work with and meet with a compassion and 'friendliness'.

        The reason I bring this up that, based on many first hand accounts, friendship among co-workers in the tech industry is one of my favorite parts of the environment, but it can also be punishing for those subject to stereotypes.
