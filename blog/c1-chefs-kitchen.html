      I'm finally coming to the end of DBC's first week of prep work... towards the end of the second week of DBC's prep work. Even though I'm quite behind at this point, I'm feeling good about my progress and ability so far. Having missed the orientation meetings last week due to travel, I was stressed by the fact that my cohort was working on projects I couldn't even find online. Once I began the work, however, I was excited to get a taste of how creative this experience will be. I can tell that the DBC instructors go to a lot of trouble making sure we students get a well-rounded experience in the curriculum and culture of the program.

      The philosophy behind DBC is that education is not as an series of facts to be consumed individually, but rather a collaborative effort to produce great work and improve the capabilities of the whole. This philosophy excites me because, for the first time in my life as a student, I'll be judged by my creativity and output rather than my ability to follow instructions. People tend to think of software engineering as solitary, robotic work. I love seeing that DBC provides the exact opposite kind of experience.
