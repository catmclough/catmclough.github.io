      In Julia Angwin's 2014 book <i>Dragnet Nation</i>, the author takes a look at the state of privacy in the modern age. Her goal is not to retreat from the world, to delete all her social media accounts, or to hide from the government. Simply put, Angwin wants to find out whether a modern American citizen has any control over who has access to the information they put online, and her conclusion is pretty grim.

      Issues over privacy have been brewing for years, and most major tech companies are taking steps to address the public's growing concern over their use of users' personal information. But as eloquently noted in a recent Parks and Rec episode on the subject, use of the internet can no longer be seen as a privelege that comes with inevitable consequences in the realm of privacy. Retreating to a cabin in the woods Ã  la Ron Swanson should not be the only way to keep personal information, personal. Companies like Google and Facebook need to be more transparent about what who has access to the emails, messages, photos, credit card information, location data, and everything else we give up so as not to fall behind.

      Below is a fascinating interview with the author of <i>Dragnet Nation</i> in which she recounts her attempts to avoid exposing her and her family's personal information online. I highly reccomend giving it a listen if you've ever wondered where all your Google searches end up, and why you should care.
