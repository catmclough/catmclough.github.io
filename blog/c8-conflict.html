      This week's cultural blog post subject is conflict which is leaving me feeling
      conflicted. Dealing with conflict has not been a real issue for me as of late,
      so I'm not sure I have any great advice to expend on the subject. They'd like
      us to talk about a time when we experienced conflict in order to draw conclusions
      and summarize what we learned from the experience, but I believe conflict is a
      a bit too general a subject to use one cure-all method for all types of confict
      that arise in life.

      I think, really, conflict in the workplace will boil down to consideration.
      When trying to get a job done, some people want to do things there way and aren't
      considerate of other people's time and value, like in the story about the dirty
      kitchen at DBC:SF. I consider myself to be pretty considerate, and I like to think
      I wouldn't direspect someone else in that way. As long as people are treating
      eachother like teammates and peers, I think conflict shouldn't be too big an
      issue.
