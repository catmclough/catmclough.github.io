  <h2>To Ask or Ask Not</h2>

      In my entire time spent in DBC's Phase 0, I never posted a question on
      the Google+ Community, never attended office hours, and never reached out for
      help with a technical issue in any capacity. Some might say this was stubborn of
      me, others might say asking questions could have saved me time/effort. It wasn't
      like I never had problems or questions about the work, I am still very much a
      novice in terms of coding. And it also wasn't that I was refusing to ask questions to keep some sort of reputation or pride. What actually happened
      was that I came in to Phase 0 with the knowledge of how to get my questions
      answered efficiently.

      One great thing about being a novice is that most of your questions have been
      asked before. Everyone who was ever a novice at JavaScript, I imagine, found
      themselves confused by the different ways to define and declare a function.
      Luckily, there are wonderful resources to answer such questions. I made great
      use of Google during Phase 0, and most of the time, Google pointed me to
      Stack Overflow. Such resources, where you glean the answers you're looking for
      from other people's questions and examples, must be used lightly though. I found
      that if I had to spend too much time with someone else's issue, I was
      probably overstretching to apply it to my own situation and therefor wasn't
      going to find much help with it.
    </p>

      Another strategy I learned through all my Googles are that very specific questions
      tend to yield better results. Today, for example, I paired with someone on
      a challenge where we were supposed to make a function that accepts
      integers as arguments and returns the English words that represent that int.
      When we got stuck, my pair's first Google was something like: "Change integers
      to words Ruby example". Needless to say, he found an example that didn't quite
      match what we were trying to do and promptly went down a rabbit hole trying
      to apply this solution to our own code. The strategy that I've found works
      best is to follow your own path and ask more specific questions along the way.
      I Googled things like "Ruby change string to int" and "Ruby delete char from
      string".

      Now that Phase 1 is starting, I do plan on asking my peers and teachers questions
      from time to time, but I plan on using the same method I used online in
      Phase 0. The answers may be available from more than one resource, but simple
      questions always seem to return the clearest solutions.
