  <h1>DevBootcamp: Week One</h1>
  <h2>Version control and the Hub of Git</h2>
  <h4>May 28, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Your first week of Dev Bootcamp, Phase 0, is all about getting set up and running with with your remote coursework. The first big idea introduced is known as version control, followed up by a crash course in a little program known as git. Finally, you'll move on to learn about the Hub of Git known as GitHub. Below, I'll do my best to explain what I think I've learned about these things.

      Version control is more of a concept than a techincal term, but its implementation in git creates a structure that makes life much easier for developers. In general, the idea behind version control is that changes to a project should be made to a copy of the project rather than the original. These changes can always be "merged" back into the "master" project, but they must be saved and approved before taking effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using an interface with version control is handy for solo projects because it safeguards against mistakes and allows the developer to revert to previous versions of their project. Group projects, however, is where version control really shines. If my team at NYU, working on a video game for the final project in our Interactive Computing class, had used an interface with version control, I would have been saved at least one sleepless night spent trying to prevent the code written by different team-members from clashing. Version control merges each team-members code (each written on separate copies of the master) through an approval process, making the collaboration seemless.

      I've used the term "git" a few times in this post, and you may be wondering what exactly that weird little word means. Git is simply a piece of software used by software developers that gives their project the framework needed to use version control. With git, a developer can create new branches (or copies) of the project, save changes to that branch, and push them to a server, like GitHub.

      What's GitHub then? I'm glad you asked! GitHub is an online environment (in other words, a website) that, like git, allows its users to collaborate seamlessly using well-documented changes. The difference between git and GitHub is that one runs locally on a developers computer and uses a command-line interface (git), and one exists on an external server so that projects are remotely accessible and uses a user-friendly graphical user interface (GitHub).
    </p>
    <p>
      Although git saves and "commits" changes to your code on its own, it's always a good idea to push those changes up to GitHub where you can store your code. This way, the code can be reviewed and commented on by other people you're collaborating with, and you yourself can access it when you're away from your computer.
    </p>

      That brings us to the end of my first technical blog post. I hope it all makes sense... I'm looking forward to getting better at these in the coming weeks!
