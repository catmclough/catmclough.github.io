  <h1>What is Rails?</h1>
  <h4>July 20, 2015</h4>

      When I think of Ruby I think of my terminal. Even though the changes I make to my
      programs and projects are uploaded to the GitHub server... they still just sit
      there -- lines and lines of code with no place to run. JavaScript, as I understand,
      is made for the web. Our flat and boring HTML/CSS pages will be brought to life
      by the interactive magic of JS, but it hasn't happened yet. This week, I'd like to
      explore Rails and its relationship to those lines of plain Ruby code sitting
      in my repositories as I write this, and maybe finally learn what people are
      talking about when they talk about Rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon first Google, this is what the internet tells you about Rails: Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby under MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. [Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails]
    </p>
    <p>
      Got it? Not exactly? Me neither. So Rails is something, similar to JavaScript,
      that will turn my code into interactive web frameworkes with built in structures
      for using databases. Cool. But if the code itself is Ruby, what exactly are we
      talking about when we refer to Rails?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's what I've gleaned about the programmer's experience with Rails:
      The software is separated into packages and installed using a package manager
      like RubyGems (which comes with the current version of Ruby). The system uses a
      model-view-controller (MVC) for application programming. The <i>model</i> here
      refers to a table in a database and the ruby (.rb) file. The <i>controller</i> is
      the client-side of things. It is where the commands from the web server come that
      are in search of a response. Finally, the <i>view</i> referred to is just what
      it sounds like, the file formatted to display the information/application at hand.
    </p>
        <p>
      In my experience with programming, it's often nearly impossible to explain to a
      lay-person the difference between things like Ruby and Rails, which represent
      processes and interaction that most internet-users never see or care to understand.
      I've taken classes in Python and Java and still find it difficult to articulate
      what those words <i>really<i> mean beyond the simple explanation that they are
      languages in which we write code. The underlying processes can be confusing and
      using the systems doesn't always mean you understand them. At the very least, I
      can now say I have a vague understanding of what people are talking about when
      they talk about Rails.
