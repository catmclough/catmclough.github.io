  <h1>Phase 0 So Far and My Concrete Random Style</h1>
  <h4>June 7, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      According to the <a href = "http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style Quiz</a> DBC had us take a few weeks back, I am a concrete random thinker. As opposed to every horoscope quiz I've ever taken or the personality tests they make you take in high school to uncover your perfect career match, this one seems to be pretty accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
        A concrete random thinker, it says, is someone who prefers experimentation, intuition, and risk-taking to thought out plans and operating procedures. Check. A conrete random thinker learns best in a competitive environment where she can work through problems alone. Check. Finally, a concrete random thinker finds it hard or frustrating to write formal reports (i.e. blog posts about their learning style) or to re-do things once they're done. So yeah, I'm three for three!
    </p>

        To be honest I forgot about the results of this quiz the minute I submitted my results. Now, in revisiting my learning style, I want to see how I can take this information and use it to improve my productivity and absorption starting in week four.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, I haven't noticed any issues regarding my tendency to experiment through trial-and-error in the programming challenges during weeks one through three. I do need to remind myself, however, that issues in programming often require a step back and consideration of overarching goals and possible solutions. Secondly, my preference for working alone on these challenges does not quite fit with the peer pairing requirements in phase 0. Although pairing is not my ideal working conditions, I'm fully aware of the practice's usefulness in the field of software development, so I'm pushing through and getting better at collaboration with every session. I often feel that I could do the challenges faster alone, not because I'm smarter or faster than my peers, but because I feel held back by the technology and sometimes, the awkwardness of working closely with a stranger. This frustration is just a product of my concrete random brain but being aware of it helps me focus on how I can improve the experience of working on challenges with a partner.

        Finally, we come to the issues that concrete random thinkers have with slowing down to reflect. This would explain my reluctance to write these very blog posts every week. But just as I've learned to appreciate the peer pairing sessions, I'm learning that the blog posts (especially the technical ones) can be vital to the learning process. Racing through challenges may be productive, but in order to absorb the information, these posts help me review and rehash everything I've learned that week. Albert Einstein said "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." I find this statement to be incredibly accurate. I've noticed over the past three weeks that I don't know whether I've got the curriculum down-pat until it comes time to write a technical blog post. This makes me glad DBC is pushing me out of my concrete random comfort zone to engage different learning styles and absorb all I possibly can.
