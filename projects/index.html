            <h2>The Book Atlas</h2>

              When I go on vacation I like to take a book that's set in or near
              my destination. So, inspired by the
              <a href="https://apps.npr.org/best-books/#view=covers&year=2020"
                >NPR Book Concierge</a>
              and <a href="https://dauntbooks.co.uk/">Daunt Books</a>, I created
              a personal database of books organized by setting or other
              associated locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The books are currently curated by myself, but this is a work in
              progress! I'd like to add support for cities, states and regions,
              a better experience for adding new books including book covers,
              and links to purchase any given book.
            </p>
            <p>
              This app served as my introduction to React. It uses a Firebase DB
              and the Google Books API for book creation.

          This is a selection of projects I created in college for a class
          called Interactive Computing. The projects are all written in
          Processing JS (now
          <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>).

            <p>
              Frogger Soccer is a chase game where you are the ball and your goal is to find the net. If you run into a defender, you've been tackled and have to start at the beginning. See how many goals you can score before being tackled five times.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was the first game I ever created. The challenge lied in learning how to track the movement of elements in a Processing program and handle collisions between them. This was also my first time creating a game loop and handling score tracking and resetting after a game has ended.
            </p>
            <p>
              The defenders are original drawings by myself, done using <a href=" https://make8bitart.com/">'make 8-bit art'</a> by the amazing <a href="https://jennmoney.biz/">Jen Schiffer</a>.

              Another collision-based game, this one with mouse-tracking. Avoid the witch and the ghost, which appear at random y-coordinates and fly through the screen while you try to collect more candy corn than they do.
            </p>
            <p>
              This game was part of my mid-term in the interactive computing class. I completed it in-class in about an hour.
