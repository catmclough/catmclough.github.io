            <h2>The Book Atlas</h2>
            <a class="project-title" href="https://book-atlas.com/">https://book-atlas.com</a>
            <p>
              When I go on vacation I like to take a book that's set in or near my destination. So, inspired by the <a href="https://apps.npr.org/best-books/#view=covers&year=2020">NPR Book Concierge</a> and <a href="https://dauntbooks.co.uk/">Daunt Books</a>, I created a personal database of books organized by setting or other associated locations.
            </p>
            <p>
               The books are currently curated by myself, but this is a work in progress! I'd like to add support for cities, states and regions, a better experience for adding new books including book covers, and links to purchase any given book.
            </p>
            <p>
              This app served as my introduction to React. It uses a Firebase DB and the Google Books API for book creation.

        <h2>NYU</h2>
        <p>
          This is a selection of projects I created in college for a class called Interactive Computing. The projects are all written in Processing JS (now <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>).

              This is the first programming project I ever completed. Bart features a click handler that reveals an exciting message to the user.
